# AdvancedInventoryManagement

Advanced Inventory Management (AIM) is a mod designed to automate the inventory of a player. By connecting different devices to a static block network, you are able to manipulate and modify the players inventory as well as other stats like xp, hunger or potion effects. The mod offers a wide range of different devices and possibilities, reaching from ways to automate your food supply to techniques for auto-healing a player when he has taken damage. All aspects of the mod are highly configurable and a lot of cool things can be achieved by combining different devices. There is also an in-game guide which covers every part of the mod in detail, describing the different blocks and items as well as things like setting up a network or managing player accessibility.
